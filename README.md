# Open-Source-Syringe-Pump

An open-source syringe pump apparatus. A convenient choice for multiple labs that might require an investment in fluid-delivery pumps.

Designed by Joshua Pearce (joshua.pearce@uwo.ca)

This syringe pump was designed using freely available open-source computer-aided design (CAD) software and manufactured using an open-source RepRap 3-D printer and readily available parts. The design should suit the needs of a given research activity requiring a syringe pump including carefully controlled dosing of reagents, pharmaceuticals, and delivery of viscous 3-D printer media among other applications.
